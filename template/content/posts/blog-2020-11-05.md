summary: "As we move past Octoberâ€™s Cybersecurity Awareness Month, I would like to bring attention to one of the efforts SAIC sponsors and contributes to that is incredibly valuable to the cybersecurity community. This initiative is open to and benefits everyone in the community: cybersecurity product vendors, system integrators like SAIC, private-sector cyber operations practitioners, and customers, which for us, include federal agencies with critical national security missions."
